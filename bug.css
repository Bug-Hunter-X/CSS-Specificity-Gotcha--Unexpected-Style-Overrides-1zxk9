The CSS specificity rules can be counterintuitive and lead to unexpected styling issues. For example, consider the following scenario:

```css
#myElement {
  color: blue;
}

.myClass {
  color: red;
}

#myElement.myClass {
  color: green; /* This style will override both #myElement and .myClass */
}
```

In this case, the element with both `#myElement` and `.myClass` will be green because the most specific selector (#myElement.myClass) wins.  However, unexpected specificity issues can arise when dealing with complex selectors, nested styles, or the use of `!important`.
